MemeMaker `0.1.2`
<br/><br/>
MemeMaker is a program that lets you choose a meme from a given set of templates and make a meme out of it. <br/>
All you have to do is choose the meme and write the words on each of the templates. The formatting is automatically done.<br/>
<br/>
<b>You must have PIL installed (sudo pip3 install pil)</b>
<br/><br/>
For now, the only meme template available is the drake template. I'm making a couple of changes so as to make the process easier to make memes and templates. For now, use whatever is there.<br/><br/>
